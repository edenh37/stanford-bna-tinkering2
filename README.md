d3

What skill you set out to learn?
I set out to experiment and learn basic D3, and see how I could integrate it with a React Framework Web App. My goal was to create a few simple data visualizations for a simple dataset, and learn about the features D3 supports


How you went about learning it. For example: links to specific tutorials, StackOverflow posts, code tinkering you performed, usage of the Developer Toolbar, etc. You're encouraged to embed code snippets in the README.md (here's how to embed code in Markdown).

I used a mix of exisiting examples from the D3 gallery, the official D3 documentation, SVG docs, a tutorial I found, and ChatGPT to get to my final product. 
Here is a link to the relevant websites I used. I also directly noted in my code often where I got the information from. 
I also left a lot of in-line comments to remind myself in the future what certain more complicated lines do.

Assessment of your degree of mastery. How well do you feel you have learned the technique? For example, could you code this technique again from memory or with minimal reference to documentation? Could you explain or teach it to someone else? If you don't feel like you've fully mastered the technique, what would be your next step(s) to deepen your understanding?

I think I've learned a lot, and am very comfortable with understanding my code / other D3 code examples. I do not think I would be able to completely code a data visualization from scratch (yet!) but I could talk through an overview of the steps necessary to someone else, as well as techniques to do so. Areas I am still a little iffy on include knowing how to size things correctly, and fully understanding the nuances of the mouseover feature. 
Useful next steps would be digging deeper into my code to ensure I understand line by line not just what I did, but WHY I did it. Furthermore, since I did use examples as a base and tailored them, it could be a useful next challenge to try and code some basic data visualization component from scratch entirely and see where the gaps in my knowledge are.
